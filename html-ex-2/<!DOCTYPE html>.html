            <p>if 2016 was a year when charitiesstarted feeling the effects of a globel economic slowdown, then they had better brace them selves for an even more pro-nounced impact over the next 12 months,said Charity Council chairman Gerard Ee. Singapur's
                economic growth farecast for this year has been projected at between 1 and 3 percent, with the world in the thros of rising political risks and tensions in international re-lations.With more charities eyeing a slice of the pie, this spells
                tough times ahead. Mr Ee, a social services vet-eran,told The New Paper:"it will be very challenging. All the more so,we charities will have to do our part and really be able to clearly articulate our causes. "People now only support causes,not
                organizations. "if you can't articulate what is it you're doing,what out-comes you're trying to aachieve,</p>
            <h3>"People now only suppot causes,not organisations."</h3>
            <span><strong>--Charity Council chairman</strong></span> <strong>Gerard Ee</strong><br> it will be so much harder to get support.Unfortunately,this is something we are not terribly good at." While official figures on do-nationsreceived
            <p> last year are not out yet,the Singapur Red Crossv(SRC),which commited $50,000 to support disaster re-sponse efforts after last year's Aceh earthquake,recorded at 35 per cent dip in corporate mon-etary donations. Non-governmental organi-sations
                (NGO) Mercy Relief laso encountered the same trend which executive director Zhang Tingjun attributed to the chal-lenging economic envirinment.The drop in corporate giv-ing comes on the heels of 17- year peak of $1.4 billion in tax-deductible
                donations in 2015-a 24.6 per cent increase from 2014.But Mr Ee said that signifi-cant jump was a one-off. He explined:"it will not be appropriate for the charitiesto compare the donationsthey re-ceive with 2015,which saw extra tax deductions
                and the eupho-ria of SG50.Donations may be getting scarcer as compenies struggle to even survive." Some charities are already adopting a morencreative ap-proach to attrecting donations. They Hue Kwan Moral Socie-ty,which runs free meal
                centers and free clinics,has invested in 10 claw machines for about $10,000. The cost was fully sponcered by an anonymous donor.Each try on the machines,which will be placed at AMK Hub and Northpoint,cost $2. SRC,meanwhile,is working with
                more corporate groups to channel their time and skill on a long-term basis.the char-ity saw a 50 per cent increase in corporate volunteers last year. Mercy Relif's MsZhang said the NGO has seen a surge in skill-based volunteering.They
                have tapped on volun-teers like the legal term at Flint&Battery,the creative and com-munications term at Edelmen and the IT support offered by CIO Academy Asia's give-back piller CIO Care. This has allowed the NGO to focus on aif relief
                and disaster management.Corporates like Vanguard In-teriors also supported the NGO by donating new office furni-ture for its new office. Such non-monetory giving is not necessarily a lesser form of hcarity,Mr Ee pointed out. "Every little
                bit counts.I don't think it'sa zero-sum game, "he said </p><br>
